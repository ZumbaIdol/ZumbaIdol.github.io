If you're learning how to code, you've probably asked yourself (and possibly others) this question.  An article I read helped to shed some light on this "mystery."  What I discovered from this particular article is that many people get into coding with an erroneous mindset.  "Upon completion of this tutorial, I'm going to be a master coder!"  Ummm, NO!  Learning to code ISN'T just about writing code; it's also about the ability to solve problems and to PRODUCE A PRODUCT!  It requires more time and practice than one may at first realize.  Just like most endeavors, in order to become good at something, you have to be bad at it for a while.  Such was the case when I first started learning to play piano.  I hadn't been playing for very long, maybe a year or so, and I was asked to play a song at a church program.  I was probably 12 or 13 at the time, I started when I was 11.  My "friends" laughed at my playing abilities (don't be too harsh on them...kids are often somewhat cruel to each other.)  What this did for me was fuel my passion even further...after some time practicing, the next time they heard me, they weren't laughing anymore; they were in awe of how I had improved.  Was it magic?  Absolutely not!  It took hard work, time, patience, and desire to get to where I wanted to be.  And today, they're ***defintiely*** not laughing!  (I don't mean to sound braggadocious or anything- wait, is that even a word?  Ah, but I digress...).  I'm coming to understand that the same will be true for this coding craft.  I'm just going to have to accept that after a few lessons, I won't build the next Facebook or Instagram, and I won't understand everything that there is to know about coding.  And the good news for me is I don't have to be an instant guru!  

According to the article I read, the real learning begins when you put all of the information from the tutorials into practice.  The best way to do this is to build something!  Again, it doesn't have to be as magnanimous as Twitter or the Windows Operating System.  It just needs to work by the sweat and tenacity of one's own efforts, utilizing the skills one has acquired.  Success is addictive!  Small successes spawn more desire for more successes and soon, one should see growth.  So back to my original question: why do I find coding to be so difficult?  Maybe it's because I thought at first that after learning some concepts and solving some coding problems that I'd be ready to take on the world.  "Hello, World!"  (See what I did, there? üòÅ)  That's not exaclty how things work unless you're some kind of coding Einstein...wait- did he ever code?  Ah, I digress...again.  Be DRY, Foote, be DRY!

If you can relate to me on this, do yourself a favor...**CHILL!**  Take a step back, take a few deep breaths.  This ride will be roller coaster and it will be lengthy, but it will also be rewarding, I believe with some time, energy, patience, and practice.  Practice.  Practice.  Practice.  Practice.  Oh, sorry, I was caught in a mini Allen Iverson *loop* momentarily (uh-oh, I did it again! ü§£)  I'm getting a little *loopy* so I think it's time for me to quit, for now...happy coding!
