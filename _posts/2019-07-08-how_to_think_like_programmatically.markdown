I recently made a statement in a standup that one of my blockers was being able to think programmatically, which prompted me to do some research on how to become better at it.  What I discovered from the article I read about this subject is that I can actually *already* think like a programmer!  It stated that if you've tried exercises on sites like freeCodeCamp, Code Academy, or Code Wars, then you already know how to think like a programmer.  So, then, does the issue now become?  The article I read calls the issue **coder's block**.  It defines coder's block as being afraid that your code will fail, being afraid to face the errors, and not knowing how to begin.  Four steps are offered to assist with overcoming coder's block:

1. Break down the problem into smaller problems
2. Find solutions to the smaller problems
3. Assemble the solutions together in a coherent manner
4. Refactor and improve

Regarding step one above, what tends to happen with many people is that they **skip steps**.  The author suggests that when coding, one should ask *every* small question one can think of.  He used an example of putting an elephant into a refrigerator.  In this example, most people would:

* Open the refrigerator
* Put the elephant inside
* Close the refrigerator

Problem solved, right?  Not exactly.  Thinking *logically* about this problem, there are some rather obvious questions that should arise:

* What kind of refrigerator?
* What kind of elephant?
* If the elephant is too big for the refrigerator, what do you do?
* Where is the elephant coming from to begin with?
* How is the elephant getting to the refrigerator?

Regarding step two above, **find solutions to the smaller problems** by **being as detailed as possible**:

* What refrigerator?  The one in your kitchen!
* What kind of elephant?  Wait...there's actually different kinds of elephants?  Yep!  I'll use an Asian elephant.
* If the elephant is too big...if?  Really?  Ok, just play along...shrink it with a shrink gun!  (You weren't going to cut it up into smaller pieces, were you?)
* Where is the elephant coming from?  I would suppose Asia since it's an Asian elephant.
* How is it being transported?  Once it's shrunken, put it in a bag and fly it home.

Sometimes, there can be deeper layers that can be explored (here's an area I feel like I need help with).  Let's revisit the shrink gun.  Where do I get one of those?  I could always ask the nutty professor who lives next door.  Where in Asia do I find this Asian elephant?  Southeast Asia in places like Sumatra or Borneo.  *Once all of the smaller questions have been answered, the next step is to piece them together in order to solve the bigger problem*.

Regarding step three above, one could possibly assemble the solutions together in manner such as this:
* Get the shrink gun from the nutty professor next door
* Fly to southeast Asia 
* Travel to Sumatra 
* Find an elephant
* Shoot it with the shrink gun
* Put the shrunken elephant in your bag
* Go back to the airport
* Fly back to America
* Travel to your house
* Put the shrunken elephant in your refrigerator

Done!

Although this isn't an actual programming example, it does illustrate thinking through a big problem by making it into smaller, easier to solve problems and then putting those solutions together in a meaningful and logical way to solve the larger problem.  **WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING THIS IN OUR FLATIRON LABS!!!**  We're already programmatic thinkers, but we just may need to overcome coder's block by diving in and tackling the problem in a more accessible way by breaking it down, then putting it back together.  During this process, other problems may surface that you didn't think of (you think?!)  Solve those, too.  Once this process is complete, there may yet still be room for improvement (refactoring, a simpler path to the solution), but hey, we've spent a lot of time with this elephant and refrigerator issue, so let's *take a break and come back fresh*...that way, we will probably be able to more clearly see the possible improvements.
